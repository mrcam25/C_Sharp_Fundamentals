## Basics

static void Main(string[]) args) {
    console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}

When launched, the .NET runtime looks for a method called Main (the entry point to the application) and starts executing the code inside it.

(string[] args) are parameters. The name of the parameters is "args" and the type is String Array.
Strings are a series of characters. A string array is a collection for those things.
Any arguements which are input will by passed in by the args parameter.
